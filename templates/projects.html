                    <p>
                        For this project, I was working entirely in Python. To recreate the game, I used the Python 
                        library Pygame, which created a window for the game to be played in, as well as creating a game loop. 
                        One of the main takeaways I gained from working on this project was practicing Object-Oriented 
                        Programming, which I had only recently learned prior to working on this project.

                    <p>
                        This project was done using Python. To create it, I initially used the Discord.py library, but 
                        later switched to using the Disnake library. The main goal I had behind building this Discord bot
                        was to enhance a small server of myself and my close friends with some custom commands that we all
                        would like to use. My biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to make API calls, which is 
                        something I hadn't done before.

                        This project led to the website you are seeing now. It was my first real introduction to HTML and CSS.
                        My main goal behind working on this project was really just to see if I could do it. I had been wanting
                        to create a website for some time, but I never really knew how. This project was me jumping in and trying
                        as I went to build my first website.

                        This was the first class project that I had worked on in my Object-Oriented Software Development course.
                        The goal of the project was to create a game where a player will see correct and incorrect UML diagrams dropping
                        from the top of the page and will have to shoot the incorrect ones with a red pen. As my first time working in a team,
                        this project gave me some good experience working with others while developing software.
